// Compiled identity of one attestation profile.

// The profile ID names WHICH evidence format and provider examine a candidate.
// The profile ruleset names WHICH VERSION of that provider's rules apply. Both
// bind into the challenge and into the signed evidence digest, so a candidate
// cannot answer a challenge issued for one profile with evidence built for
// another, and cannot ask for a weaker profile when its own fails.
//
// The verified binary carries the whole set. There is no loader, no negotiation
// and no configuration switch: an unknown ID has no provider and fails closed.
